# Personal_Virtual_assistant
# Description
This project aims to design a prototype model for a Personalized Virtual Assistant. The Virtual assistant is designed in such a way that it verifies a user by its face and if a user is not verified than user has to register first to start using the Virtual assistant. The only pre-requisite to use this Virtual assistant is that, the image for verification must be captured in a well lit area so that the face is clearly visible through webcam. It uses Natural Language Processing to provide assistance in voice mode.
